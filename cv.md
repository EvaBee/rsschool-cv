### Briefly About Myself:
Having started my stading as a student of course backend development with minimum skills, I became profficient in programming.
My keen interest in digital technologies led me to stading different courses, where I continued self-learning, examining the process of learning a programming language Python , creating applications in Django framework.
Despite the lack of specialized education, I have a craving for self-study and further development in the field of digital technologies and programming.

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
